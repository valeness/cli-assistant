cli-assistant1.1
================

Like Siri, but cyberpunk as hell and CLI.

================

HOWTO:

1: Drop the 'cliassis.py' file into your Python directory. (Usually located at C:\Python27) Your number may be different
2: Run the script with python by navigating to your python directory inside a command prompt (python cliassis.py)
3: That's it! The script is running and now all you have to do is set up the custom commands and set your directory.

================

Commands and Opening Programs:

Sadly, CLI Assistant can not search your computer for programs, you will need to specify a directory full of shortcuts
to programs that you want to open with CLI Assistant. My directory is "C:\\shortcuts\"

**It is important that you end your directory with a backslash**
***All programs dropped in this directory need to end in .lnk, signifying that it is a shortcut***

Commands are executed by denoting a precursory string. The easiest way to explain this is through example.
If I want to google something, I would need to first type 'google' and then my search query. So to google "tony stark",
I would have to type "google tony stark". However, these commands are set by you to be custom, meaning that the precursor 
'google' could be anything. Like: "ubenflabin tony stark" would work perfectly fine if I set the google command to be 
'ubenflabin' on startup.
